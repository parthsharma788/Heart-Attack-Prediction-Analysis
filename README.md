# Heart Attack Prediction And Analysis 

This project aims to explore the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques in predicting heart attacks. 
We will examine ML models, including supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, and assess their performance in predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data.

Technologies used :
                   Python - Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn , Scikit Learn ( Logistic Regression )
