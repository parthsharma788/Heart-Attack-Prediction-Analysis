# Heart Attack Prediction And Analysis 

**This project aims to explore the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques in predicting heart attacks. 
We will examine ML models, including supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression and assess their performance in predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data.**

### Overview
**Heart attacks, medically known as myocardial infarction, occur when a blockage in the coronary arteries restricts blood flow to the heart.
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to assess patient data and predict the probability of heart attack occurrences.**

### Purpose
**The primary goal is to build a robust predictive model to help in early diagnosis and intervention, improving patient outcomes.
This project aims to provide an accurate and scalable solution that can be used in clinical settings for early diagnosis, ultimately helping in the prevention of heart attacks and improving patient care outcomes.**

### Dataset
**The dataset used for this analysis includes patient health metrics such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, and more. It was sourced from Kaggle's Heart Attack Prediction Dataset.**

### End Result
We got **87% accuracy** and **88% AUC** with the **Logistic Regression model**.

### Technologies Used
**Python: For data preprocessing and model building.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Seaborn and Matplotlib: For data visualization and EDA.**
