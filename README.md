# Heart Attack Prediction And Analysis 
This project aims to explore the application of data analysisand  machine learning techniques in predicting heart attacks. 
We will examine ML models, including supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, and assess their performance in predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data.
